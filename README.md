# Hello there!

Welcome to my bio site repository, you can find the site here: https://azim-dev.vercel.app/

My name is **Azim Muradov**, and I'm a curious developer, hacker (^1),
and active contributor to the open-source community.

My main interests in programming are **program verification** and **symbolic analysis**.
Iâ€™m also a big fan of Kotlin, functional programming, C, Rust and low-level programming in general.
