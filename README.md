# Hello there!

Welcome to my bio site repository! My name is **Azim Muradov**, and I'm a curious developer, hacker[^1],
and active contributor to the open-source community.

Right now, I am studying under the program "**Software Engineering**" at the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of
St. Petersburg State University.

I mainly program in Kotlin, Rust and Haskell.

In my free time, I'm busy with maintaining my pet [projects](https://azim-dev.vercel.app/projects), cooking,
and listening to music (I'm a fan of prog rock and jazz).
