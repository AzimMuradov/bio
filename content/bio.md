My name is **Azim Muradov**, I am 22 y.o. I was born in the municipal city of Peterhof, located in the federal city of St. Petersburg.

Right now, I am studying under the program "**Software Engineering**" at the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of
St. Petersburg State University.

My main interests in programming are **program verification** and **symbolic analysis**.
Iâ€™m also big fan of Kotlin, functional programming, C, Rust and low-level programming in general.

In my free time, I'm busy with maintaining my pet projects, cooking,
and listening to music (I'm a fan of prog rock and jazz).
